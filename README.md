Malware Hash Analyzer
Overview

The Malware Hash Analyzer is a Python-based tool that automates the process of checking file hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) against various threat intelligence sources. This tool streamlines the incident response process by quickly identifying whether a given file hash is associated with known malware or other malicious activities.

This project demonstrates my skills in:

    Automation development using Python
    Integration with threat intelligence APIs
    Hash-based malware detection and triage in an incident response environment

Features

    Hash Lookup: The tool supports hash lookups for MD5 and SHA-256 file hashes.
    Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrates with API from VirusTotal
    Automation: Automatically queries hashes from a file and fetches results in bulk.
    Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple command-line interface for checking individual or multiple hashes.
    Detailed Reports: Provides easy-to-read results, including threat detection status, reputation scores, and additional metadata if available.

Installation
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    pip (Python package manager)
    A free API key from VirusTotal or any other threat intelligence source you plan to use.

Step-by-Step Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Malware-Hash-Analyzer.git

Navigate into the project directory:

bash

cd Malware-Hash-Analyzer

Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure your API key by adding it to a .env file:

makefile

    VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key_here

Usage
Basic Hash Lookup

You can use the tool to check a single hash or multiple hashes from a file.
1. Checking a Single Hash

bash

python hash_analyzer.py --hash <your-hash-here>

2. Checking Multiple Hashes from a File

Place the file hashes you want to analyze in a hashes.txt file, each on a new line:

bash

python hash_analyzer.py --file hashes.txt

Example Output

makefile

Hash: 44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f
Status: Malicious
Source: VirusTotal
Details: Trojan.Win32.Agent

Available Commands

    --hash <hash>: Query a single file hash.
    --file <filename>: Provide a file containing multiple hashes to check.
    --api <api-key>: Specify your API key (alternatively use the .env file).

Testing

You can test the tool using the hashes.txt file, which includes both benign and malicious hashes for testing the automation.
Future Enhancements

Some potential features to be added in future versions:

    Support for additional threat intelligence APIs
    Support for additional hashing algorythms
    Hash submission for scanning (if not yet recognized)
    Automatic alerts for flagged hashes
    Integration with SIEM platforms for automatic threat intelligence updates
